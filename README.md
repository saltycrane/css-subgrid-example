# css-subgrid-example

This is the code for a demo I did on [CSS Subgrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Subgrid).

[Watch the demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7c_RpJYUg)

There are 2 git branches in this repo:

- `without-subggrid` has code similar to the code at the **start** of the demo
- `with-subggrid` has code similar to the code at the **end** of the demo

(The code in this repo is slightly different than the code in the YouTube demo because I converted from using PostgreSQL to SQLite so I could include the data in this repo.)

## Usage

This is a Next.js React project using CSS Modules. (As [mentioned in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7c_RpJYUg&t=83), I wanted to use vanilla HTML and CSS for the demo, but this was just easier for me since I'm familiar with it.) To run the demo:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 in the browser
